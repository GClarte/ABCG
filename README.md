# ABCG
ABC gibbs code and data.

toydata, toyparam and toyparamsig contains the data used for the toy example of the hierarchical Moving average;

fullsimulationsMA.R contains the code needed for the analysis of the moving average model

3Dhier.R contains the code for hierarchical model in 3D.

To reproduce the figures of the main examples, simply run the files:
execute_gk_simple.R, execute_hierarchical.R and execute_gk.R ; 
the functions used are in the corresponding function_[...].R file. Beware that the parameters for gk are simulated at each run, so you will have to change the range of the plots most likely.
